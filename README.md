### Objective

Passionate for systematic and iterative procedures. High educability and deep knowledge of computer science makes me efficient in engineering and architecture that provides a logical flow of knowledge and progress.

### Skills

#### Paradigms [*](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-forgotten-history-of-oop-88d71b9b2d9f "Programming using these kinds of objects does not make your code 'object-oriented' any more than programming with functions makes your code 'functional'")
